    </text>
    <text>We the people of The Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe do hereby enact this Membership Code in order to avoid sex discrimination; provide criteria for membership for children; provide criteria for membership for spouses; and, to provide for applications for membership and appeals of determinations by the Tribal clerk.</text>
    <text>The purpose for the Code is to ensure the ongoing strength of the people of The Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe; to provide fair and just criteria for eligibility; and, to provide notice concerning eligibility requirements.</text>
    <text>People presently enrolled as members on the Tribal Roll will not be removed as a result of the enactment of this Code.</text>
    <text>Applications for membership are to be made through the Tribal Clerk; should someone disagree with the Tribal Clerk, then provisions are made for appeal to a Membership Court. All will be done in a timely manner.</text>
